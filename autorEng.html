                <p>Malba Tahan taught mathematics through fiction and this is where the great curiosity lies. Born in 1885, in Saudi Arabia, whose work would be translated by the fictional professor Breno Alencar Bianco, is nothing more than the pseudonym of the Brazilian mathematician and writer Júlio César de Mello e Souza. </p>

                    <p>Malba Tahan or Ali Yezzid Izz-Edin Ibn-Salin, was a famous Arab writer, descendant of a traditional Muslim family, born on May 6, 1885, in the Arabian Peninsula in a village called Muzalit, close to the ancient city of Mecca. He did his first studies in Cairo and later moved to Constantinople where he officially completed his Social Sciences course. The publication of his first literary works, in the Turkish language, in several newspapers and magazines dates back to this time. Among his most notable works are the following: Roba el-Khali, Al-Saneir, Sama-Ullah, Maktub, Legends of the Desert and many others.
                        <br><br>
                        At the invitation of his friend, Emir Abd El-Azziz Ben Ibrahim, Malba Tahan held the position of “quaimaquam” in the city of El-Medina for several years, having performed his administrative functions with rare intelligence and skill. He managed, once again, to avoid serious accidents between pilgrims and local authorities, always seeking to provide valuable and disinterested protection to illustrious foreigners who visited the holy places of Islam.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        With the death of his father, in 1912, at just 27 years old, Malba Tahan received a large paternal inheritance, where he left the position he held in El-Medina and began a long journey through various parts of the world, such as Japan, Russia and India. He died in combat, in July 1921, near El-Riad, when fighting for the freedom of a small tribe in Central Arabia.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        But what is common between the Brazilian mathematician, Júlio César and the Arab writer, Malba Tahan? Although there appears to be no connection, they are both actually the same person. Malba Tahan is the heteronym or pseudonym that the professor uses to create his stories. Such is his creativity that he himself invented his fictional biography, in addition to countless short stories similar to the plots of the Arabian Nights. Taking advantage of the context, he also widely disseminated Mathematics through his works. The writer even received a special concession from then President Getúlio Vargas to have his heteronym printed on his identity card.</p>
